## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


### Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing deploying and testing of software platforms which are user friendly.
Imporatance of software engineering in the technology industry. 

* Complexity Management:Software engineering provides the principles, methods, and tools to manage this complexity, such as modular design, abstraction, and architectural patterns.
* Scalability and Adaptability:Technology companies can ensure that their software solutions can grow and evolve with the changing market and user demands.
* Quality Assurance: Software engineering emphasizes testing, verification, and validation techniques to ensure that software products meet the desired quality standards.
* Productivity and Efficiency: By improving productivity and efficiency, technology companies can deliver software solutions more quickly and at a lower cost, giving them a competitive advantage in the market.
* Maintainability and Sustainability:By applying software engineering best practices, technology companies can ensure the longevity and relevance of their software products in

### Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
* Mastering Complexity (1950s–1970s) – Structured programming and high-level languages like C made coding more manageable.

* Mastering Process (1980s–1990s) – Development models (Waterfall, Agile) and version control improved project organization.

* Mastering Machine (2000s–Present) – Cloud computing, AI, and DevOps enabled scalable, efficient, and automated software development.

### List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Define project goals, scope, and resources.
Requirements Analysis – Gather and document user needs.
Design – Create system architecture and technical specifications.
Implementation (Coding) – Write and develop the software.
Testing – Identify and fix bugs to ensure functionality.
Deployment – Release the software for use.
Maintenance – Update and improve the software as needed

### Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
* Waterfall Example: Building a banking system where requirements must be clear and fixed before development begins.

* Agile Example: Developing a mobile app where user feedback is needed regularly to refine features.

### Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
* Software Developer – Writes, tests, and maintains code to build software applications.
  
* Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests software for bugs, ensures quality, and verifies functionality meets requirements.

* Project Manager – Plans, coordinates, and oversees the development process to ensure timely and successful project delivery.

### Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
* IDEs – Improve coding efficiency by providing features like debugging, auto-completion, and syntax highlighting. Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.

* VCS – Tracks changes, enables collaboration, and prevents data loss. Examples: Git

### What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

* Debugging Complex Code – Use debugging tools, log errors, and break down the problem step by step.

* Meeting Deadlines – Follow Agile methods, prioritize tasks, and use project management tools.

* Keeping Up with New Technologies – Take online courses, read tech blogs, and engage in continuous learning.

* Collaboration Issues – Use clear documentation, version control (Git), and communication tools like Slack.

* Security Risks – Implement secure coding practices, conduct regular security audits, and stay updated on threats

### Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

* Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly. Importance: Catches bugs early.

* Integration Testing – Verifies that different modules or services work together properly. Importance: Ensures seamless data flow.

* System Testing – Tests the entire application as a whole. Importance: Checks if the system meets functional and non-functional requirements.

* Acceptance Testing – Evaluates if the software meets user needs and business requirements. Importance: Ensures user satisfaction before deployment.

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


### Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Definition: Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to effectively interact with AI models for accurate and relevant responses.

Importance:

* Enhances AI Performance – Well-crafted prompts improve the quality of AI-generated results.
* Increases Efficiency – Saves time by reducing the need for multiple iterations.
* Customizes AI Responses – Tailors outputs for specific use cases like coding, writing, or data analysis.

### Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
* vague prompt: "Places to visit in nairobi"
* Well engineered prompt: "List affordable places to visit in Nairobi with their entry prices and key attractions"
